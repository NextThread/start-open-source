This project aims to simplify and guide the way beginners make their first contribution. If you are looking to make your first contribution, follow the steps below.

Make necessary changes and commit those changes

Now open **Contributors.md** file in a text editor, add your name to it. Don't add it at the beginning or end of the file. Put it anywhere in between. Now, save the file.




``**git status**``
If you go to the project directory and execute the command git status, you'll see there are changes.

Add those changes to the branch you just created using the git add command:





``**git add Contributors.md**``
Now commit those changes using the git commit command:


``**git add .**``
If you have done changes in multiple files. Else use the above command.





``git commit -m "Added your-name to Contributors list"``
replacing your-name with your name.
